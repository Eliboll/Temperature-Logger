# Temperature-Logger
simple Flask server which logged temperature pings from an ESP8266 connected to a temperature sensor.

Created to log tempuratures in my bedroom 24/7 as the tempurature would fluctuate greatly, especially in the summer.
From this I could derive patterns, and adjust my workflow to keep myself out of the room during the hottest times

templog.ino needs to have the network credentials and serve IP adress updated before flashing to ESP8266 board.

# Temperature-Logger
simple Flask server which logged temperature pings from an ESP8266 connected to a temperature sensor.

Created to log tempuratures in my bedroom 24/7 as the tempurature would fluctuate greatly, especially in the summer.
From this I could derive patterns, and adjust my workflow to keep myself out of the room during the hottest times
